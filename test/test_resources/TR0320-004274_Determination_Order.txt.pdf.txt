In the matter of Marguerite O Driscoll [Appellant Tenant] and Tuath Housing Association 
[Respondent Landlord], the Residential Tenancies Board, in accordance with section 121 of 
the Residential Tenancies Act 2004, makes an Order as per the Terms and Conditions of the 
agreement of the parties as follows, in respect of the tenancy of the dwelling at 31 Meadow 
Crescent, The Meadows Hollyhill, Cork, ( “the dwelling”): 
1. The Appellant Tenant shall pay the total sum of €535 to the Respondent Landlord, in 33 
consecutive fortnightly payments of €16, to be paid with the fortnightly rent of €124, followed 
by one payment of €7 
in the immediately succeeding week, commencing on the 9th 
December 2020 in respect of the tenancy of the dwelling at 31 Meadow Crescent, The 
Meadows, Hoilyhill, Cork, T23P6YN. 
2. The enforcement of this Order for such payment of €535 shall be deferred and the total 
sum owing reduced by the cumulative sum paid in the fortnightly instalments made by the 
Appellant Tenant to the Respondent Landlord on each due date until such time as the total 
sum of €535 has been paid in full. 
3. For the avoidance of doubt, any default in the payment of the fortnightly instalments shall 
act to cancel any further deferral and the balance due at the date of default of any such 
fortnightly payment shall immediately become due and owing to the Respondent Landiord. 
4. The Appellant Tenant shall pay any rent outstanding from the 9th December 2020, at the 
rate of €124 per fortnight, payable in advance, unless lawfully varied, and any other charges
